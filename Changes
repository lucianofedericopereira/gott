Revision history for gott

0.3.0  2026-02-16
  - Added 'gott rebase [base]': rebase current branch onto a given base
    (defaults to refs/remotes/origin/main), matching the Git UX where the
    argument is the new base rather than the branch being rebased. Users
    switching between Git and Got no longer need to manually update their
    work tree before rebasing. Thanks to Stefan for the suggestion.

0.2.0  2026-02-15
  - Renamed binary: gottool -> gott
  - Added git interop commands: git-remote, git-pull, git-push, sync
  - Added patch export (gott patch) and patch apply (gott apply)
  - Added branch-based stash: gott stash / gott unstash
  - Added gott nb (new branch + switch in one step)
  - Colour output via ANSI codes (disabled when not a TTY)
  - repo_path() helper walks up from cwd to find .got/repository
  - gott-remote and gott-stash files stored inside bare repo
